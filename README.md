# MOVIE_NIGHT

For now there are 10 genres that you can select from and consquently 10 lists.

### Open a pull request or DM me if:

1. You like the movie.
2. imdb's score >= 7.0 (I know that imdb is shit but stilll:-))
3. imdb's tags must match the list you would like to add the movie into (Again the tags are shit sometimes but stillll:-) )

Example: "L.A. Confidential" has "Crime", "Mystery", and "Drama" as tags and has a score of 8.2 on imdb so you add it to [CRIME.md](https://github.com/adarijani/MOVIE_NIGHT/blob/main/CRIME.md), [MYSTERY.md](https://github.com/adarijani/MOVIE_NIGHT/blob/main/MYSTERY.md), and [DRAMA.md](https://github.com/adarijani/MOVIE_NIGHT/blob/main/DRAMA.md).
